WIP Game launcher for godot

For the moment Godot Engine didn't include a basic launcher for game as Unity.
This addon has the purpose to offer a basic launcher with somes functionality as:

- news reader (rss / file)
- custom theme/background/logo via project settings
- pre-game settings (aka graphics settings)
- mod support (aka .pck loading)


WIP:
- UI design
- rss news
- better custom via projects settings
- mod support
- key binding (godot inputs)
